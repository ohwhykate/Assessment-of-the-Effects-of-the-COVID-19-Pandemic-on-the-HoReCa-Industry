## Project Overview
<b>Assessment of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic in the HoReCA industry </b> is a project based on a survey used for my bachelor's thesis. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the hotel and gastronomy industry were assessed by guests and people professionally associated with the HoReCa industry. In order to assess the situation in the industry, three independent surveys were conducted. Their questionnaires were addressed to three groups of respondents: owners, employees and guests.
